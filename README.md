## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS - Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Styled Components](https://styled-components.com/) - For styles
- [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) - For checking the design

### What I learned

- In this challenge I have learned how to make customized radio inputs, taking care accessibility issues.
- I deeped in some of the main characteristics of styled-components to customize components.
- I discovered how to use the useRef hook to check if a click was made outside a component (to close a modal or a navigation menu).

### Continued development

What's next? 
- I want to focus in the fetch Api. 
- I will implement a dark/light switcher with styled-component.
- I need to learn more about the useRef hook.

### Useful resources

- [Capturing click outside a component with useRef hook](https://medium.com/@pitipatdop/little-neat-trick-to-capture-click-outside-with-react-hook-ba77c37c7e82) - This helped me to implement the useRef hook to close the modal and the navigation menu if a click was made outside the component.
